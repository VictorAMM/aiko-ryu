## 🏗️ **Architecture Principles**

### **🧬 Genesis Principle**
Every agent instance is born from extracted user intentions via LLM analysis. Agents are created dynamically based on semantic understanding of requirements.

### **🧠 LLM as Capability, Not Center**
Intelligence is distributed across agents rather than centralized. Each agent has specialized LLM capabilities for their domain.

### **🛡️ Nothing Trusted, Everything Verified**
No inference is assumed true without validation. All suggestions pass through:
- Local validation (schema, contracts)
- Distributed consensus with peers
- Explicit validation before system action

### **🤝 Consensus Before Action**
High-impact decisions require peer validation and consensus mechanisms.

### **🛰️ No Silent Nodes**
Every agent is traceable, auditable, and recoverable with comprehensive observability.

---

## 🎯 **Core Capabilities**

### **Intent Genesis**
- Analyzes input prompts (textual, structured, or hybrid)
- Derives semantic intent and suggests agent composition
- Enables "intent-born" agent creation from dynamic demands

### **LLM Statefulness**
- Maintains contextual internal state (memory slices)
- Supports dynamic behavioral mutations based on context
- Enables hot-swap behavior changes without losing traceability

### **Context Slicer**
- Transforms and propagates context slices between agents
- Ensures isolation and traceability of each inference
- Prevents state sharing issues

### **Validation Chain Adherence**
- Every inference passes through validation pipeline
- Local validation (schema, contracts)
- Distributed consensus when required
- Never acts directly without explicit validation

### **Resilience & Observability**
- All actions are observable, loggable, and auditable
- Built-in circuit breakers, fallbacks, and retries
- Participates in recovery mesh - no silent failures

### **Infinite Loop Detection & Enhanced Error Handling**
- Real-time loop detection with pattern analysis
- Circuit breaker pattern with three-state protection
- Context enrichment for optimal agent retries
- Alternative agent routing with capability mapping
- Comprehensive error tracking and recovery strategies

## 🚀 **Performance Optimizations**

### **GPU Acceleration**
```javascript
const GPU_CONFIG = {
  num_gpu: 1,           // Use 1 GPU
  num_thread: 1,        // Minimal CPU threads
  num_ctx: 512,         // Context window
  num_batch: 512,       // Batch size
  f16_kv: true,         // Use FP16 for key/value cache
  mul_mat_q: true       // Use matrix multiplication
};
```

### **Direct CLI Integration**
- **Eliminates HTTP overhead** by using Ollama CLI directly
- **Real-time token streaming** for better user experience
- **GPU detection** with automatic CUDA/Metal detection
- **Event-driven architecture** with EventEmitter

### **Network Optimization**
```javascript
const NETWORK_CONFIG = {
  connectionPooling: true,
  requestBatching: true,
  responseCompression: true,
  caching: true,
  timeout: 30000
};
```
