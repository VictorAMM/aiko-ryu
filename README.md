# AikoRyu Autonomous Agent System

## 🎯 Overview

AikoRyu is an autonomous agent orchestration system that implements Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Specification-Driven Development (SDD) principles. The system consists of specialized agents that work together to provide intelligent, context-aware services with built-in validation, observability, and cultural transformation capabilities.

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run specific test file
npm test -- test/aikoAgent.test.ts

## 🏛️ Architecture Principles

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- **Bounded Contexts**: Each agent represents a specific domain
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Consistent terminology across the system
- **Aggregates**: Agents as domain aggregates with clear boundaries
- **Domain Events**: Event-driven communication between agents

### Specification-Driven Development (SDD)
- **Formal Contracts**: AgentContract interface ensures consistency
- **Validation Rules**: Built-in validation for all specifications
- **Design Intent**: Clear purpose and goals for each component
- **User Requirements**: Traceable requirements to implementation

### Autonomous Agent Principles
- **Self-Contained**: Each agent manages its own state and lifecycle
- **Event-Driven**: Communication through events and messages
- **Observable**: Comprehensive tracing and monitoring
- **Resilient**: Graceful error handling and recovery

## 🧭 DDD/SDD Alignment

### Domain-Driven Design Integration

#### **Bounded Contexts & Domain Boundaries**
Each agent in the AikoRyu system represents a distinct bounded context:

- **AikoAgent**: Semantic validation and LLM enablement domain
- **SarahAgent**: Knowledge retrieval and RAG operations domain
- **RyuAgent**: System integrity and audit domain
- **AlexAgent**: Workflow orchestration and DAG management domain
- **MayaAgent**: Context management and cultural transformation domain
- **BusinessLogicAgent**: Business rules and decision-making domain

#### **Ubiquitous Language Implementation**
The system maintains consistent terminology across all components:

- **Agent**: Autonomous, self-contained processing unit
- **Event**: Immutable message representing a state change
- **Trace**: Observable record of agent activity
- **Specification**: Formal contract defining agent behavior
- **Validation**: Verification of data and behavior consistency
- **Context**: Shared state and knowledge across agents

#### **Domain Events & Aggregates**
- **Event Sourcing**: All state changes captured as events
- **Aggregate Roots**: Agents serve as aggregate roots for their domains
- **Event Store**: Immutable audit trail of all system activities
- **CQRS**: Command-Query Responsibility Segregation for performance

### Specification-Driven Development Integration

#### **Formal Specification Contracts**
Every agent implements the `AgentContract` interface with:

```typescript
interface AgentContract {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly role: string;
  readonly dependencies: string[];
  
  // Core lifecycle methods
  initialize(): Promise<void>;
  handleEvent(eventType: string, payload: EventPayload): Promise<void>;
  shutdown(): Promise<void>;
  
  // DDD/SDD validation methods
  validateSpecification(spec: AgentSpecification): ValidationResult;
  generateDesignArtifacts(): DesignArtifact[];
  trackUserInteraction(interaction: UserInteraction): void;
  
  // Observability methods
  emitTrace(event: TraceEvent): void;
  getStatus(): AgentStatus;
}
```

#### **Design Intent & User Requirements**
Each agent includes explicit design intent:

- **Purpose**: Clear statement of agent's role and responsibilities
- **User Goals**: Specific user objectives the agent addresses
- **Success Metrics**: Measurable outcomes for validation
- **Design Principles**: Guiding principles for implementation
- **Accessibility Requirements**: Inclusive design considerations

#### **Validation Chain Adherence**
- **Local Validation**: Each agent validates its own inputs and outputs
- **Consensus Validation**: Multi-agent agreement for critical decisions
- **Schema Validation**: Type-safe data structures and interfaces
- **Business Rule Validation**: Domain-specific rule enforcement

### Cultural Transformation Integration

#### **Organizational Culture Modeling**
The system supports cultural transformation through:

- **Design Thinking**: User-centric problem-solving approach
- **Cross-Functional Teams**: Collaborative agent interactions
- **Continuous Learning**: Adaptive behavior based on feedback
- **Psychological Safety**: Error-tolerant, learning-oriented environment

#### **Cultural Metrics & Observability**
- **Collaboration Patterns**: Agent interaction frequency and quality
- **Learning Velocity**: Rate of system improvement and adaptation
- **Psychological Safety**: Error reporting and recovery patterns
- **Innovation Metrics**: New capability development and deployment
