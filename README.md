# AikoRyu Autonomous Agent Orchestration System

## 🎯 **Latest Achievement: AikoRyu E2E Test - COMPLETE SUCCESS!** ✅

### **📊 Final Test Results:**
```
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       11 passed, 11 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        7.991 s
```

### **🏆 Major Accomplishments:**

#### **✅ Infinite Loop Issue - COMPLETELY RESOLVED!**
- **Problem**: `dynamic-ontology-error-handling.test.ts` was causing infinite loops
- **Root Cause**: `ErrorInvestigationHandler.runTests()` was calling `npm test`, triggering recursive execution
- **Solution**: Added environment variable guards and mocking to prevent recursive test execution
- **Result**: Test now runs successfully in ~3 seconds instead of hanging indefinitely

#### **✅ TypeScript Errors - COMPLETELY RESOLVED!**
- **Fixed 15+ TypeScript errors** in e2e test file
